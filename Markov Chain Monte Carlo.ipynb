    "In a [recent article](https://github.com/IamGianluca/bayesian_methods/blob/master/Bayesian%20AB%20testing%20framework.ipynb) we introduced the opportunity to leverage the Bayes Theorem to run A/B testing. Bayesian data analysis however is not limited to it. There are infinite ways we can use such theorem to answer very complex questions, which are sometimes impossible to model using a frequentist approach. Before jumping into the many ways we can do Bayesian inference, I want you to focus on Markov Chain Monte Carlo (often seen abbreviated as MCMC).\n",
